- Show civilization maturity: knowing what must not be done, ability to respect boundaries
- Show that humanity is entering phase where constraint must become conscious value
- Show that we are gaining power to reshape boundaries, but must also gain wisdom
- Label: "A mature species is not one that can do everything—it is one that knows what it must not do"

### 5. Intelligence Beyond Optimization
**File:** `intelligence_beyond_optimization.jpg`
**Location:** Section "Intelligence Beyond Optimization"

**Prompt:**
Create an illustration showing intelligence as navigating constraints:
- Show economic growth without ecological boundaries (eroding biosphere)
- Show information flow without epistemic boundaries (corroding trust)
- Show power without institutional boundaries (breeding instability)
- Show that intelligence is ability to navigate constraints without collapsing them
- Show that this redefinition is civilizational, not just technical
- Label: "Intelligence is not the ability to maximize objectives—it is the ability to navigate constraints"
- Include text: "This redefinition is not a technical adjustment—it is a civilizational one"

### 6. The Role of Meaning in a Boundary World
**File:** `meaning_boundary_world.jpg`
**Location:** Section "The Role of Meaning in a Boundary World"

**Prompt:**
Create an illustration showing meaning and boundaries:
- Show shared meaning depending on stable semantic boundaries
- Show common reference points, trusted institutions, aligned expectations
- Show fragmentation: boundaries breaking, societies polarizing, coordination failing
- Show rebuilding meaning as repairing interfaces (not enforcing consensus)
- Show that this is slow work requiring dialogue, humility, patience
- Label: "Rebuilding meaning is not about enforcing consensus—it is about repairing interfaces"
- Include text: "Meaning is not imposed—it is maintained through interfaces"

### 7. Technology as Moral Amplifier
**File:** `technology_moral_amplifier.jpg`
**Location:** Section "Technology as Moral Amplifier"

**Prompt:**
Create an illustration showing technology amplifying values:
- Show platform optimizing for engagement
- Show how it amplifies assumptions: engagement is valuable, attention is resource, virality is success
- Show how these assumptions shape behavior long after designers move on
- Show that design decisions are moral decisions
- Show that choosing interface is choosing future
- Label: "Technology does not create values—it amplifies them"
- Include text: "Choosing an interface is choosing a future"

### 8. The Quiet Spiritual Implication
**File:** `spiritual_implication.jpg`
**Location:** Section "The Quiet Spiritual Implication"

**Prompt:**
Create an illustration showing the spiritual implication:
- Show reality as relationships stabilized by boundaries, not things
- Show that separation is never absolute
- Show every self existing because of interface, not despite it
- Show identity maintained through relation
- Show we are boundary-maintaining patterns in living web of constraints
- Show meaning arising from participation, not domination
- Label: "We are not isolated actors—we are boundary-maintaining patterns in a living web"
- Include text: "Meaning arises not from domination, but from participation"

### 9. Humility in the Face of Possibility
**File:** `humility_possibility.jpg`
**Location:** Section "Humility in the Face of Possibility"

**Prompt:**
Create an illustration showing humility:
- Show small interface changes having vast effects
- Show design decision reshaping global communication
- Show deployment decision affecting millions
- Show policy decision altering possibility space
- Show that power demands care
- Show universe surviving billions of years by respecting constraints
- Label: "We are powerful not because we know everything, but because small changes have vast effects"
- Include text: "The universe has survived for billions of years by respecting constraints. We would do well to learn from it."

### 10. A Future Still Open
**File:** `future_still_open.jpg`
**Location:** Section "A Future Still Open"
