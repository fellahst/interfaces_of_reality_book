This book emerged from a collaboration between human insight and artificial intelligence. The core ideas, arguments, and perspectives are my own, developed over years of practice and reflection. However, the process of articulating, structuring, and refining these ideas was significantly enhanced through dialogue with AI systems.

This collaboration itself illustrates one of the book's central themes: that meaning and intelligence are not properties of isolated minds, but emerge from interfaces that enable coordination, shared understanding, and mutual refinement. Working with AI to develop this book has been, in a sense, a practical demonstration of the interface-centric view of reality.

I am grateful for the tools that made this work possible, and for the many thinkers, researchers, and practitioners whose ideas have shaped my understanding of interfaces, boundaries, and the structure of reality.
