\mypart{Rethinking What Reality Is Made Of}

The journey begins with a question that seems simple but proves to be one of the most profound in all of science: what is reality actually made of?

For centuries, we've believed the answer is obvious. But the evidence tells a different story. For centuries, the answer has been objects. Particles, atoms, molecules, cells, organisms, things that combine to create more complex things. This view is intuitive, powerful, and remarkably successful for many purposes. But it also leads to mysteries that have puzzled scientists and philosophers for generations.

Why do eyes evolve the exact same design independently, across millions of years and completely different evolutionary paths? How does a cell remain itself when every single molecule is replaced? What makes you \textit{you}, even as your body completely renews itself? Why do AI systems, trained separately, discover identical structures for language and vision? These are not isolated puzzles. They point toward something deeper, a hidden structure in reality itself.

The first three chapters of this book reveal a radical shift in perspective that solves these mysteries. Instead of thinking of reality as made of objects, we begin to see it as made of \textit{stable interfaces} navigating a structured space of possibilities. This shift does not eliminate objects, but it transforms our understanding of them. Objects become what interfaces create, not what reality is fundamentally composed of.

In Chapter 1, we discover where object-thinking breaks down completely. In Chapter 2, we explore the extraordinary evidence for convergence and structured possibility spaces. In Chapter 3, we introduce interfaces as the solution, the boundaries that make stability, persistence, and coordination possible.

This foundation will change how you see everything. Once you understand interfaces, they appear everywhere: in physics, in life, in mind, in meaning, and in the systems we design. The universe is not a collection of things, but a web of boundaries holding reality together.
