\chapter{Glossary}

This glossary defines key terms as they are used in this book. Many of these terms exist in other disciplines; the definitions here reflect their interface-centric meaning, not necessarily their most common usage.

### Interface

A boundary that regulates interaction between systems, enabling stability, coordination, and persistence under change. Interfaces shape how influence flows without eliminating interaction.

### Boundary

A constraint that limits, filters, or conditions interactions between systems or subsystems. Boundaries can be physical, informational, semantic, inferential, or institutional.

### Possibility Space

The set of all states or trajectories a system could in principle occupy. Interfaces carve this space into viable and non-viable regions.

### Stability

The persistence of a pattern, behavior, or structure despite noise, perturbation, or variation.

### Emergence

The appearance of stable, higher-level patterns due to layered constraints and interfaces, without introducing new substances or forces.

### Constraint

A limitation that reduces degrees of freedom in a system. Constraints are not opposed to freedom; they enable meaningful behavior.

### Markov Blanket

An inferential boundary separating a system's internal states from external states via sensory and active states, making prediction and agency possible.

### Free Energy Principle

A theoretical framework stating that systems which persist must minimize surprise relative to their expectations, effectively maintaining their interfaces.

### Agency

The capacity of a system to act in order to preserve its coherence or viability within a structured environment.

### Semantic Interface

A boundary that stabilizes meaning, reference, and interpretation across agents, enabling communication and shared understanding.

### Ontology

A formalized semantic interface that defines stable distinctions, relationships, and inference rules within a domain.

### Interface-First Ontology Engineering

An approach to ontology design that prioritizes boundary stability and interaction over exhaustive representation.

### Agentic AI

Artificial systems that select actions, pursue objectives, and intervene in the world, rather than merely predicting outcomes.

### Boundary Preservation

The ethical principle that responsible action maintains the interfaces that sustain shared viability and meaning.
