## Missing Illustrations (5 sections):

### 1. Semantics as Negotiated Constraint
**Section:** Lines 99-106
**Key Concept:** Meaning is negotiated through use; bounded disagreement is a feature, not a bug. Legal ontologies create boundaries within which disagreement can occur.

**Prompt:**
"A conceptual diagram showing 'Semantics as Negotiated Constraint.' The diagram shows a boundary or frame labeled 'Ontology Interface' that creates a bounded space. Inside this boundary, various legal arguments, evidence, and precedents are shown as elements that can disagree and vary (shown as different colored shapes or text elements). The boundary itself defines what counts as valid (valid legal argument, evidence, precedent) shown as the frame. Two lawyers are shown on opposite sides, both inside the boundary, with speech bubbles showing they disagree about a specific case, but they both respect the same boundary rules. The diagram emphasizes that bounded disagreement enables coordination—the boundary constrains disagreement without eliminating it. Abstract, legal/philosophical illustration style with clear visual separation between the bounded space and the outside."

### 2. Ontologies and Power
**Section:** Lines 107-116
**Key Concept:** Ontologies shape behavior by deciding which distinctions matter. Classification systems for people demonstrate how different ontologies create different categories that influence behavior.

**Prompt:**
"A split-screen comparison diagram showing 'Ontologies and Power: How Classification Shapes Behavior.' Left side: A classification system that distinguishes only by race and gender, shown as a rigid grid with limited categories (Male/Female, Race1/Race2). People are shown as simplified shapes forced into these boxes, with arrows showing how this shapes understanding and treatment. Right side: A classification system that distinguishes by profession, education, and interests, shown as a more flexible, multi-dimensional network with diverse categories. People are shown with more nuanced representations that emphasize capabilities and affinities. Below both sides, show how a hiring system would behave differently: left side shows biased filtering, right side shows skill-based evaluation. The diagram emphasizes that ontology choices are not neutral—they create categories that influence behavior. Social, data visualization style with clear contrast between the two approaches."

### 3. Why Formalization Helps
**Section:** Lines 117-128
**Key Concept:** Formalization sharpens boundaries and forces explicit commitments. Compare informal (natural language) vs formal (logic) ontologies showing how formalization makes boundaries testable.

**Prompt:**
"A side-by-side comparison diagram showing 'Why Formalization Helps: Sharpening Boundaries.' Left side: An informal ontology shown as fuzzy, ambiguous boundaries in natural language. Text shows vague statements like 'a customer can place an order' with question marks and unclear edges. The boundaries are shown as blurry, overlapping regions. Right side: A formal ontology showing the same concepts but with sharp, precise boundaries expressed in formal logic. The boundaries are shown as clear, well-defined lines. Specific questions are answered: 'Can a customer place multiple orders? Yes. Can multiple customers place the same order? No. Can an order exist without a customer? No.' The formal side shows testable, verifiable boundaries with checkmarks. The diagram emphasizes precision in boundaries, not accuracy in representation. Technical, mathematical illustration style with clear visual contrast between fuzzy and sharp boundaries."

### 4. Ontology Alignment as Interface Translation
**Section:** Lines 141-150
**Key Concept:** Alignment is interface negotiation, not concept mapping. Medical and legal ontologies can align even with different structures if their interfaces allow compatible interactions.

**Prompt:**
"A diagram showing 'Ontology Alignment as Interface Translation.' Two separate ontology interfaces are shown: left side shows a medical ontology with its internal structure (diseases, symptoms, treatments) and its interface boundary. Right side shows a legal ontology with its internal structure (injuries, damages, liability) and its interface boundary. Between them, a translation layer or bridge labeled 'Interface Negotiation' connects the two. The translation shows that 'disease' does not map directly to 'injury,' but the interfaces can coordinate—a medical record flows through the translation layer, with some details filtered out (shown as faded elements) but preserving what matters for legal reasoning. The diagram emphasizes that perfect alignment is not needed—sufficient alignment for coordination is enough. The ontologies remain separate but can interact through their aligned interfaces. Technical, interoperability illustration style showing the translation process."

### 5. Ontologies as Living Interfaces
**Section:** Lines 151-160
**Key Concept:** Ontologies must evolve like software interfaces. HTTP protocol example: core interface (request-response) remains stable while details evolve.

**Prompt:**
"A lifecycle diagram showing 'Ontologies as Living Interfaces: Evolution Through Time.' The diagram shows a timeline with an ontology interface at different stages. At the beginning, a simple core interface is shown (labeled 'Core Commitments' or 'Essential Boundaries'). As time progresses, the core remains stable (shown as a solid, unchanging frame), but extensions, new properties, and edge cases are added around it (shown as new modules or layers). The diagram shows version numbers (v1.0, v2.0, v3.0) with the core interface remaining constant. An example shows HTTP protocol: the core 'request-response pattern' remains stable across versions, while new features (HTTPS, HTTP/2, HTTP/3) are added as extensions. The diagram emphasizes that living interfaces preserve identity while adapting details. Technical, lifecycle illustration style showing evolution over time with stable core and changing extensions."
